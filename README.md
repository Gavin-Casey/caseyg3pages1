<p>To say that the city of Malcan has a lot of wizards is an understatement. It would be like saying that Mount Caldin has dwarves or the Gelto desert has camels. Not only is Malcan home to the Malcan University of Magic, but the entire city happens to be located on an extremely dense pool of magical energy, so many graduates end up staying in the city, increasing its wizard population every year. 
One such wizard has just woken up thanks to an alarm spell. His name is Edus, a wizard of slightly above average skill, who had graduated from MUM less than a decade ago. He had graduated with a degree in Anti-Thaumaturgy, which was just a fancy way of saying he was really good at counterspells, antidote potions, and similar practices. As such, he now has a job helping non-magical sentients deal with magical problems. Edus got out of bed, did his morning stretches, and with a flick of his wrist, cast a cleaning spell on himself. Edus then went on to change out of his nightgown and into his work clothes. He could have used a cloth-change spell, but he wasn’t that lazy. Edus soon went downstairs and prepared his breakfast. He decided on a simple meal of toast and eggs. He would have liked some Almy fruit, but it was out of season. And every wizard worth their fae dust knew never to eat out of season Almy fruit. After his breakfast was prepared, he sat down and used a quick attraction spell to bring him the morning paper. While Edus wasn’t so lazy as to use a cloth-change spell, he was lazy enough to not go pick up the paper.</p>
